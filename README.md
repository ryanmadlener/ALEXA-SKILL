# Ryan's Weather App (Alexa Skill)

Ryan's Weather App is an Alexa skill that takes a user defined zipcode and returns the temperature in the zipcode in celsius and fahrenheit

For instance,

User: "Alexa, ask ryans weather app whats the weather in 98075"

Alexa: "The temperature in 98075 is 32 degrees celsius and 90 degrees fahrenheit"


The skill uses an OpenWeatherMap API to get the temperature data in kelvin, which I then convert to celsius and fahrenheit.
